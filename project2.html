		<p> this is an interactive storybook made with stratch. it is still in its prototype phase. <br>
		there is a physical book that goes with it, and there are 3D folded elements. each part is handdrawn and handcut. <br>
		the book is meant to represent the two cat's house. there are a few rooms and when interacting with the specific <br>
		buttons we get to go to different parts of the house. make sure to hold the cat's hand to travel throughout their life! <br> <br>
		plans for this project to go further is adding more locations as well as finalizing the overall construction <br>
		of the physical part.
