		<p> this is a project made in p5.js. this specific project combines javascript and CSS. <br>
		I have followed the tutorials "make 3d math flowers in p5.js" by Kazuki Umeda on youtube. <br>
		in this project, you can modify a 3d flower to your liking. you are able to change the number of petals, <br>
		the diameter, the length of the petals, its sharpness, the overall height, the different curvatures <br>
		as well as the bumpiness. <br> <br>
		this project uses math equations to be able to achieve the visuals. some obstacles i faced were <br>
		some coding mishaps, but overall i was able to pull through. i enjoyed making this project, because <br>
		i have learnt a lot. i have learnt more javascript and now understand the 3d aspects much better.  <br>
