		<p> this is a platformer made in unreal engine. there are different mechanisms from falling platforms to moving ones, <br>
		as well as a mini maze. the goal in this game is to be able to make it through all the obstacles without failing. <br>
		<br>
		this being my first UE made it a bit challenging as deciding how to make gameplay interesting without focusing <br>
		on art isn't something that is in my comfort zone. the game is meant to be casual and easy to play for anyone. <br>
		there are four levels, and they progressively get harder. coding some mechanics were tougher, but i ended up <br>
		replacing it with other mechanics.
